            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Chinaman’s Waterfall is another gem of Mahabaleshwar, located close to the town’s main attractions. The waterfall derives its name from the Chinese prisoners who were believed to have maintained the gardens nearby. Falling from a height of 500 feet, it offers a mesmerizing sight, especially during the monsoon season.</p>

            <h3>What To Expect?</h3>
            <p>The trek begins with a scenic trail passing through dense forests, small streams, and ancient stone pathways. On reaching the top, you'll find the Siddheshwar temple, a small water tank, and the ruins of the fort's bastions. The Vanartok Pinnacle, a unique rock formation, is a key attraction for climbers.

                The fort provides a panoramic view of the Alibaug coastline and nearby villages. During the monsoon, the surrounding waterfalls and misty ambiance add to its charm. Be prepared for a slightly steep climb, especially near the pinnacle.

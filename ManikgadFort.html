            <h3>What To Expect?</h3>
            <p>The trek to Manikgad Fort is moderately challenging, starting with dense forests and gradually ascending to rocky trails. Along the way, you’ll encounter remnants of ancient fortifications, stone pathways, and water reservoirs. At the summit, the ruins of the Shiva temple and the fort’s bastions provide a glimpse into its glorious past.

                The fort offers stunning views of the Karnala and Prabalgad ranges, making it a perfect spot for photography and relaxation. With its serene atmosphere and relatively less crowded trails, it is ideal for those seeking solitude in nature.
